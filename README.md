# Flappy-Bird-Arduino-Project

Flappy Bird is a popular game in which the player has to make a flying bird go through pairs of pipes with equally sized gaps. The game ends when the birds hit one of the pipes, showing the general score and the highscore.
This university project uses an Arduino microcontroller, an LCD display, a button and a HC-05 Bluetooth module in order to create the whole game from scratch. The following repo includes only the code for the game and for the button attachment.
